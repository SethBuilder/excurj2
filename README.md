[This is the link](http://www.excurj.com) to the most recent *published* version of excurj.
The next version will be a PWA-AMP app! So, a 'Progressive Web Accelerated Mobile App' app.

# What are PWA-AMPs ?
Software's biggest problem is ditribution which Web excels at but it fails when it comes to the best UX compared to Native.
In a nutshell PWA-AMPs bring the best of both worlds, ahhh heaven.

Note that Progressive Web development differ from Progressive Enhancement (also known as Cutting the Mustard as coined by the BBC). 
In a nutshell, Progressive Enhancements *enhances* UX based on browser capabilites, *while as* PWA imrpoves UX (and gracefully downgrades it), 
based on network connectivity.

The best UX possible includes both concepts on top of eachother. Some AMP is great too as it significantly reduces the page load size, and most
importantly it makes Google cache it for you! so when users reach your site via Google Search it opens instantly! (or near instantly)
